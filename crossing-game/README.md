## FEATURES

* Gameplay
  * Player moves vertically across the screen listening for keydown and keyup button press events on left or right arrow keys to control movement
  * Enemy movement is handled automatically through variable assignments and class methods 
  * Enemy Collision and Goal Collision are both handled by the same function that looks for x or y overlap with the GameCharacter class variables
  * Alerts are thrown on collision detection, and a win/lose state is determined dependent on enemy or goal overlap
  * Game refreshes after win/lose state to reset the canvas for a new round

## FUTURE FEATURES

* Add levels that increase enemy speed after each win
* Save player progress with localstorage
* Add Vertical movement to Player using up and down arrow keypress

## TECHNICAL MILESTONES

* Learning how to control movement on the canvas through class components and game logic

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
